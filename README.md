## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ryan, passionate about exploring the frontiers of AI technology, with a focus on building intelligent agents and evaluation systems. I love creating software that pushes the boundaries of what's possible and changes the world.

Currently working on **OpenAlita** and diving deep into AI agent research.

ðŸ’¼ What I've worked on:

- **OpenAlita**: Building an AI agent framework that pushes the limits of intelligent systems and autonomous decision-making. Inspired by the incredible work of the Alita team.  
  *URL*: [github.com/ryantzr1/OpenAlita](https://github.com/ryantzr1/OpenAlita)
  
- **Agent Research**: Exploring cutting-edge AI agent capabilities, including reasoning, tool use, and multi-modal interactions. Following exciting open-source projects like:
  - *Alita*: Agent that autonomously creates MCP tools.
  - *OpenManus*: General-purpose AI assistant.
  - *LightEval*: Lightweight evaluation framework for language models.

- **EvalHub** (Discontinued): Built a platform to help researchers and developers discover evaluation metrics for AI models, streamlining the evaluation process. Stepped away to climb mountains in Europe!  
  *URL*: [github.com/ryantzr1/evalhub](https://github.com/ryantzr1/evalhub)

- **FRIDAY Conversational AI Agent**: A platform for knowledge base understanding, training, and customer service. Won **1st Place (AI/ML Category)** at NUS Fintech Hackathon 2023. Also somehow got paying customers out of it.

âš¡ Fun Fact
When I'm not immersed in AI and Deep Learning, I enjoy learning new languages, exploring different cultures, and cheering for the Golden State Warriors as a huge fan!
