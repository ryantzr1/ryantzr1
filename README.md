## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm passionate about Machine Learning, AI Research, and building software that changes the world. I'm particularly interested in LLM Evaluation Space.

Focused on building [EvalHub](https://github.com/ryantzr1/evalhub) right now.

ðŸ’¼ Notable Projects
- [EvalHub](https://github.com/ryantzr1/evalhub): A platform designed to help researchers and developers discover evaluation metrics for their machine learning models, streamlining the process of evaluating AI models.
- [Fine-tuning Large Language Models (DeepSeek Base)](https://github.com/ryantzr1/fine-tuning-llm): Exploring the use of Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) for efficient model fine-tuning and deployment.
- [Predicting Singlife clients' purchasing behaviors](https://github.com/ryantzr1/NUS-Datathon-2024): Won 2nd Place in the ML category at NUS Datathon 2024.
- [FRIDAY Conversational AI Agent](https://github.com/ryantzr1/FRIDAY-1): A platform for knowledge base understanding, training, and customer service. Won 1st Place (AI/ML Category) at NUS Fintech Hackathon 2023.

ðŸ“š Favourite Research Papers
- ["One-Shot Learning of Object Categories" by Fei-Fei et al.](http://vision.stanford.edu/documents/Fei-FeiFergusPerona2006.pdf): Pioneering work on learning new object categories from a single example.
- ["Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762): Fundamental paper introducing the Transformer model, revolutionizing natural language processing.
- ["A Feature Integration Theory of Attention" by Treisman and Gelade](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028580900055): Influential theory on how humans integrate different features of objects to focus attention.

ðŸŒ± Learning and Goals
- Currently deepening my understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP), advanced Deep Learning techniques, and Computer Vision.
- Aiming to contribute to AI research and develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.
- Actively participating in Kaggle competitions to sharpen my skills and collaborate with the global data science community.

âš¡ Fun Fact
When I'm not immersed in AI and Deep Learning, I enjoy learning new languages and exploring different cultures.
